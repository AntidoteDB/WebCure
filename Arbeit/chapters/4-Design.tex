\label{Design}

This chapter is needed specifically, if the work is meant to design or implement some sort of software system. In good alignment with basic software engineering practice, the system's design is to be presented at a reasonable level of abstraction. Appropriate notations are to be identified, e.g., UML diagrams, pseudocode, formal specifications, or declarative programs may be appropriate.
