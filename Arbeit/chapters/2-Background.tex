\chapter{Background}
\label{Background}

This chapter is needed, if the thesis requires background material on less established concepts, technologies, etc. or if the existing resources are not easily applicable to the problem of the thesis or need to integrated in one place. The chapter should be concise and refer to existing resources (publications, textbooks, etc.), whenever appropriate.

\section{Related Work}

This chapter is needed, if the thesis is somewhat research-oriented. (This should be usually the case.) In some cases though, the thesis may also be more application- or implementation-oriented, in which case a designated related work chapter may not be necessary, but instead citations are just used appropriately throughout the thesis, but specifically in the chapters Introduction and Background. Literature search could be based on DBLP.

Maybe you can mention SwiftCloud here.
