\section{Motivation}

The motivation of this thesis is to explore the possibilities of implementing a web-client with a cache on a client-side. 

\section{Research questions}

The following research questions are going to be addressed in this thesis:
\\\\
\textbf{RQ1.} How efficient is it to use a web-client with cache rather than without it?
\\\\
\textbf{RQ2.} What are the methods available to implement web-applications that would be able to work off-line and in the conditions of poor network connections?
\\\\
\textbf{RQ3.} What could be a scalable solution for transmitting CRDT data between a server and clients?
