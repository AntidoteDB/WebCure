\label{Implementation}

In this chapter, we are going to explain the major problems that we encountered during the implementation phase.

Addressing the client, we will name the frameworks and techniques that we are going to use in the implementation phase. Concerning the server, which is going to provide the RESTful interface, though, we will cover the use cases.
