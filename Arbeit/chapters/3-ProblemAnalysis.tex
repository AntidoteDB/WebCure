\section{Requirements}

This chapter is needed specifically, if the work is meant to design or implement some sort of software system. In good alignment with basic software engineering practice, the requirements for this system have to be developed systematically. Each requirement should have a short name, a short description, and some illustration. Additional elements are priorities (must, should, can), pointers to related work, and a discussion of the challenges involved.
