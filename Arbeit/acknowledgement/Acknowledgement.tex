I would like to take this opportunity and express my biggest gratitude to everyone, who supported me through all the ups and downs I had during my time at the Univesity of Kaiserslautern. 

Firstly, I am very grateful to Prof. Dr. Arnd Poetzsch-Heffter and my thesis supervisor Dr. rer. nat. Annette Bieniusa for making it possible for me to work on the topic that suits my area of interest. Moreover, I want to thank Dr. rer. nat. Annette Bieniusa for having the door to her office always open for a discussion, whenever I needed it. I could not ask for more.

Next, I would like to thank the stuff at Software Technology Group, who made me feel very welcome and patiently answered any questions I had. Especially, Mathias Weber, Peter Zeller, and Deepthi Akkoorath.

Finally, I want to mention my family and, particularly, my parents. They did their very best to encourage and motivate me throughout the whole period of my study in Germany. Nothing of it would ever be possible without them. Thank you.
