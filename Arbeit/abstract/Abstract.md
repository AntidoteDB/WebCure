The purpose of this thesis is to explore the possibilities of developing an offline web application, which would serve as a client for the AntidoteDB database. We developed a prototype of the application and designed the architecture of the application in such a way that both offline and online functionalities are possible. 

To model the data stored offline in the local database of a web-browser, Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs). It lets to ease the task of merging the changes. 

Apart from that, the client-server protocol was designed, in order to support the functionality of the application. The paper could be divided into two parts: firstly, the problem of designing mentioned solution is going to be discussed. Secondly, there is an implementation part and a description of how specific problems were tackled.
