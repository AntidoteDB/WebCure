The goal of this thesis is to design a web-client for Antidote-DB with a support of caching with a further implementation. In order to achieve this goal, the understanding of how CRDT works needs to be reached. The paper could be logically divided into two parts: firstly, the problem of designing mentioned solution is going to be discussed. Secondly, there is an implementation part and description how specific problems were tackled.
